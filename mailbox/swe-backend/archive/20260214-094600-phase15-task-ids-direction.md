# Phase 1.5 Task ID Direction

Proceed with **Set 2**. Please:
1) Fix SLA integration tests and complete **AOF-ae6**.
2) Implement ops alerting under **AOF-1m9**.
3) Close Set 1 duplicates (AOF-r7b, AOF-8cq, AOF-br2, AOF-tzd) as duplicates, referencing the corresponding Set 2 completions.

This supersedes the earlier brief’s Set 1 IDs. Thanks.
