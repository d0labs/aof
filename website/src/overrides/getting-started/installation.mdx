AOF can be installed in two modes: as an **OpenClaw plugin** (recommended) or as a **standalone CLI/daemon**.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** (AOF uses native ES modules)
- **npm 9+**
- **OpenClaw** (for plugin mode) — see [openclaw.dev](https://openclaw.dev)

## OpenClaw Plugin Mode

This is the recommended installation for agent deployments. AOF registers directly with the OpenClaw gateway and exposes tools to all connected agents.

<Steps>

1. **Install AOF**

   ```bash
   npm install -g aof
   ```

   Or add it to your project:

   ```bash
   npm install aof
   ```

2. **Run the integration wizard**

   ```bash
   aof init
   ```

   This wizard will:
   - Locate your OpenClaw config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`)
   - Register the AOF plugin and add it to the allow list
   - Sync your org chart with OpenClaw's registered agents (bidirectional)
   - Optionally configure AOF as the memory provider
   - Install the AOF companion skill to `~/.openclaw/skills/aof/`

3. **Restart the OpenClaw gateway**

   ```bash
   openclaw gateway restart
   ```

4. **Verify registration**

   ```bash
   openclaw gateway status
   ```

   You should see `aof` listed in the active plugins.

</Steps>

### Manual Plugin Registration

If you prefer to configure manually, add AOF to your `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "aof": {
      "enabled": true,
      "config": {
        "dryRun": false,
        "dataDir": "~/.openclaw/aof",
        "gatewayUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:18789",
        "gatewayToken": "your-token-here",
        "maxConcurrentDispatches": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Aside type="caution">
`dryRun: false` is required for the scheduler to actually dispatch tasks. In dry-run mode, the scheduler will evaluate but not mutate state.
</Aside>

## Standalone Mode

Use standalone mode when you're not running OpenClaw, or for CI/CD environments.

<Steps>

1. **Clone and build**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seldon-Engine/aof.git
   cd aof
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Optional: add to PATH**

   ```bash
   # Add to your shell config (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc.)
   alias aof="node /path/to/aof/dist/cli/index.js"
   ```

3. **Initialize a project**

   ```bash
   aof init
   ```

   This runs an interactive wizard that creates your project structure.

4. **Start the daemon**

   ```bash
   aof daemon start
   aof daemon status
   ```

</Steps>

## Initializing a project

The `aof init` command connects AOF to your OpenClaw installation:

```bash
# Interactive (recommended)
aof init

# Non-interactive — accept all defaults
aof init --yes
```

The wizard runs four steps: plugin registration, org chart sync, memory configuration (optional), and companion skill installation. Each step is idempotent, so it's safe to re-run.

See the [CLI reference](/guide/cli-reference#init) for a full walkthrough of what each step does.

Task directories (`tasks/backlog/`, `tasks/ready/`, etc.) are created automatically by AOF as tasks are written — you don't need to create them manually.

## Memory Module Configuration

AOF includes an optional memory module (disabled by default). To enable it:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "aof": {
      "config": {
        "modules": {
          "memory": {
            "enabled": true
          }
        },
        "memory": {
          "embedding": {
            "provider": "openai",
            "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
            "apiKey": "sk-..."
          },
          "search": {
            "hybridEnabled": true,
            "vectorWeight": 0.7,
            "bm25Weight": 0.3,
            "maxResults": 10
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Aside type="note">
If you're using `memory-core` (OpenClaw's built-in memory plugin), AOF's memory module is disabled by default to avoid conflicts. You can enable both — they use separate storage — but you'll need to configure the embedding provider for AOF's module independently. See [Memory Module Setup](/guide/memory) for details.
</Aside>

## Verifying Your Installation

```bash
# Check CLI is working
aof --version

# Check daemon health (if running)
curl http://localhost:18100/health

# Validate org chart
aof org validate

# Run a dry scheduler cycle
aof scheduler run
```

## Structuring Your Team

The `aof init` wizard imports your agents as a flat list. To organize them into an actual Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with roles, routing rules, and workflow gates, use the **SDLC Setup Prompt**.

Read the guide on [Generating an SDLC Org Chart](/guide/org-charts#generating-an-sdlc-org-chart) for the interactive prompt to give your main agent.
