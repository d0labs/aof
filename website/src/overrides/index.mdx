## Why AOF?

Multi-agent systems have a coordination problem. Agents run in parallel, share state, drop work on failure, and have no built-in mechanism to enforce quality gates or process stages. AOF solves this.

  <Card title="Filesystem-first" icon="document">
    Tasks are Markdown files — human-readable, diff-able, tool-agnostic. State transitions use atomic `rename()` — no database, no race conditions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SDLC enforcement" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Multi-stage workflow gates (implement → review → QA → approve) with rejection loops that agents cannot skip.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deterministic scheduling" icon="setting">
    Lease-based locking, adaptive concurrency, SLA enforcement — all without LLM involvement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protocol system" icon="random">
    Structured handoff, resume, and completion messages give agents crash-safe, typed inter-agent communication.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cascading dependencies" icon="list-format">
    Task completion or blocking immediately propagates to dependents. No polling loops needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tiered memory" icon="magnifier">
    Hot/warm/cold tier architecture with HNSW vector search for agent memory across projects.
